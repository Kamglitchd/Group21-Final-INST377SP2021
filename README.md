#  [Housing Database Website](https://group21-inst377.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
We attempted to create a website that could show statistics of Maryland based on zip code using Maryland Census Data and other data. The information that the website has access to is taken from a database that a member of our group developed in the past. The database contains data relevant to anyone looking for information to supplement their home browsing process in different areas and communities.

## Target Browsers
